<strong>History<br>
<mark>
Founding and early years<br>
<b>
<p>The school's history dates back to 12 February 1951, when it commenced its services as "Pillayar Padasalai" with 48
students and volunteer teachers. The dream of establishing a school for the Tamil-speaking Hindu community in Colombo
was realised through the efforts of the founders and the support of parents, old boys, and well-wishers.
The school initially started in a small building and expanded over the years to accommodate the growing number of
students. In 1955, classes above the fifth grade were transferred to the then-newly established Hindu College at
Ratmalana. The primary school continued in Bambalapitiya.
