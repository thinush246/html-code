    <p>...The Lego Group began in the workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen (1891–1958), a carpenter from Billund, Denmark, who began
    making wooden toys in 1932.[7][8] In 1934, his company came to be called "Lego", derived from the Danish phrase leg godt
    [lɑjˀ ˈkʌt],[9][10] which means "play well".[11] In 1947, Lego expanded to begin producing plastic toys.[12] In 1949 the
    business began producing, among other new products, an early version of the now familiar interlocking bricks, calling
    them "Automatic Binding Bricks". These bricks were based on the Kiddicraft Self-Locking Bricks, invented by Hilary Page
    in 1939 and patented in the United Kingdom in 1940[13] before being displayed at the 1947 Earl's Court Toy Fair.[14]
    Lego had received a sample of the Kiddicraft bricks from the supplier of an injection-molding machine that it
    purchased.[15][16][17][18] The bricks, originally manufactured from cellulose acetate,[19] were a development of the
    traditional stackable wooden blocks of the time.[12]..</p>
