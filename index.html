                Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients,
                such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.

                Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of
                a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
                often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat,
                etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.               
                [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

                A hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
                typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese,
                lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard,
                mayonnaise, relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are
                frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called
                a cheeseburger. Under some definitions, and in some cultures, a burger is considered a sandwich.
